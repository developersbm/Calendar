## ✨ Core Features

This section outlines the project's current features, covering both the frontend (what users see and interact with) and the backend (the behind-the-scenes system that handles data and logic).

### Frontend

- **What it does**: The frontend is the interface users interact with. It allows users to:
    - Manage their Calendar (create, edit, and view events).
    - Interact with a chatbot (create events).
    - Work with Groups (interact with shared calendars or plans for a group of people).
    - Set up and monitor Saving Plans (track financial goals or progress).
- **Design priorities**:
    - **Responsiveness**: Ensures the interface looks and works smoothly across both desktop and mobile devices, with extra attention to mobile usability.
    - **Templates feature**: Includes pre-made event layouts like "Wedding" that users can customize (e.g., add details for "Food," "Host," "Participants").
    - **Technical base**: The frontend is built using modern frameworks (Next.js, React) to keep the web-app lightweight, fast, and scalable.

### Backend

- **What it does**: Acts as the brain of the platform, ensuring the frontend works seamlessly by:
    - Handling data requests (saving or retrieving user data).
    - Managing user authentication securely (e.g., logging in and verifying users).
    - Interacting with the database to store and fetch information about calendars, templates, groups, and saving plans.
- **Security**:
    - User authentication uses secure services like AWS Cognito.
    - Data is stored safely using cloud-based database solutions like AWS RDS.

### Cloud Computing

- **Why it's used**: To ensure the app is scalable, always available, and capable of handling user data without performance issues.
- **Current Cloud Setup**:
    - Stores user and app data in a reliable database (AWS RDS).
    - Provides hosting for the app's backend (AWS EC2) and frontend (deployment platform AWS Amplify).
    - Securely manages user sessions and authentication.
- **Services Used**:
    - AWS RDS – for managing relational database operations and storing structured user data.
    - AWS EC2 – to host and run backend services with full control over the environment.
    - AWS Amplify – for seamless frontend deployment, CI/CD, and environment management.
    - AWS Cognito – for secure user authentication, authorization, and session management.
    - Amazon VPC – to isolate and control networking for the app with subnets and IP ranges.
    - Security Groups – to define inbound and outbound traffic rules for EC2 instances.
    - Route Tables – to manage traffic routing within the VPC and between subnets.
    - Amazon API Gateway – to expose RESTful endpoints and efficiently manage API traffic.
    - Amazon CloudWatch – to monitor logs, metrics, and system performance.
    - IAM (Identity and Access Management) – to enforce granular access controls across AWS services.

## 🎨 Frontend Overview

### What It Does

The frontend is the user-facing component built with Next.js and React. It allows users to:

- Manage their calendars (create, edit, view events)
- Interact with group plans and shared calendars
- Set up and monitor saving plans for financial goals

### Design Priorities

- **Responsiveness**: Optimized for desktop and mobile.
- **Celebration Plan Feature**: Pre-made customizable event layouts
- **Modern Frameworks**: Built using Next.js and React for performance and scalability.

### State Management with Redux

Redux is used to centralize the app's data, making it easier to share and update information across components. States represent the current condition of the app (like user info or UI settings) and change in response to user actions or API calls.

#### `state` Folder

This folder organizes the app's state management and API integration.

1.  **`api.ts`**
    -   Manages API calls using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query`.
    -   Defines endpoints for each resource (e.g., users, groups, events).
    -   Automatically generates hooks for each API endpoint (e.g., `useGetUsersQuery`, `useCreateUserMutation`).
    -   Example: `getUsers` fetches a list of users; `createUser` sends new user data to the backend.

2.  **`index.ts`**
    -   Manages the global UI state using `createSlice`.
    -   Handles states like whether the sidebar is collapsed or if dark mode is enabled.
    -   Example: `setIsSidebarCollapsed` action toggles the sidebar state.

3.  **`interface.ts`**
    -   Defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures used throughout the frontend.
    -   Ensures type safety and alignment with the backend's Prisma schema.
    -   Example: `User` interface represents a user object (ID, name, email, etc.).

## ⚙️ Backend Overview

### What It Does

The backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, serves as the engine of the platform by:

- Handling data requests (saving, retrieving, and manipulating user data)
- Managing authentication and session validation
- Interacting with the PostgreSQL database via the Prisma ORM

### Key Components

1.  **Prisma ORM**:
    -   An Object-Relational Mapping tool that simplifies database interactions.
    -   Provides a type-safe API for querying and manipulating the PostgreSQL database (hosted on AWS RDS).
    -   Manages database schema migrations and updates.

2.  **Controllers**:
    -   Contain the business logic for handling API requests and generating responses.
    -   Interact with Prisma to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
    -   Keep the codebase modular by separating endpoint logic.
    -   Example: `getCalendars` fetches all calendars and related data (events, user, group); `getCalendar` fetches a specific calendar by ID.

3.  **Routes**:
    -   Map specific API endpoints (e.g., `/calendar`, `/event`) to their corresponding controller functions.
    -   Act as the entry point for API requests, directing them to the appropriate controller logic.
    -   Example: `router.get("/")` in `calendarRoutes.ts` maps to the `getCalendars` controller; `router.get("/:id")` maps to `getCalendar`.

4.  **`index.ts`**:
    -   The main entry point for the server application.
    -   Initializes the Express app, sets up middleware (like CORS, body parsing).
    -   Imports and integrates all route modules (e.g., `calendarRoutes`, `eventRoutes`).
    -   Defines the server's home route (`/`) and starts the server listening on the configured port.

### Example Route Handlers

- `POST`: Create/update events, groups, or saving plans.
- `GET`: Fetch calendars, events, and financial plans.
- `DELETE`: Remove user-related data.

## 🌐 Networking & VPC (AWS Setup Example)

Timely utilizes a secure and scalable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup on AWS.

-   **VPC (`pm_vpc`)**: Provides an isolated network environment.
    -   `IPv4 CIDR`: `10.0.0.0/16` (Defines the private IP address range for the VPC)
-   **Subnets**: Isolated sections within the VPC for organizing resources.
    -   **Public Subnet (`pm_public-subnet-1`)**: Resources can have direct access to the internet.
        -   `CIDR block`: `10.0.0.0/24`
        -   Typically hosts resources like the EC2 instance running the backend server.
    -   **Private Subnets (`pm_private-subnet-1`, `pm_private-subnet-2`)**: Resources do not have direct internet access, enhancing security. Deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
        -   `CIDR block (1)`: `10.0.1.0/24`
        -   `CIDR block (2)`: `10.0.2.0/24`
        -   Typically hosts the RDS PostgreSQL database instance.
-   **Internet Gateway (`igw-xxxxxxxx`)**: Allows resources in public subnets to communicate with the internet. Attached to the VPC.
-   **NAT Gateway (Optional but Recommended)**: Placed in a public subnet, allows resources in private subnets to initiate outbound connections to the internet (e.g., for fetching updates) without allowing inbound connections.
-   **Route Tables**: Control the flow of traffic within the VPC.
    -   **Public Route Table (`pm_public-route-table-1`)**: Associated with public subnets.
        -   Route `0.0.0.0/0` -> `Internet Gateway`: Directs internet-bound traffic to the IGW.
    -   **Private Route Tables (`pm_private-route-table-1`, `pm_private-route-table-2`)**: Associated with private subnets.
        -   Route `0.0.0.0/0` -> `NAT Gateway` (if used): Directs internet-bound traffic from private subnets through the NAT Gateway.
        -   Includes routes for local VPC traffic.
-   **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic for resources like EC2 instances and RDS databases.
    -   `pm_ec2-sg`: Allows inbound traffic on necessary ports (e.g., 80/443 for HTTP/S, 22 for SSH) from specific sources (like your IP or anywhere, depending on needs). Allows outbound traffic as needed.
    -   `pm_rds-sg`: Allows inbound traffic on the database port (e.g., 5432 for PostgreSQL) only from trusted sources, typically the EC2 instance's security group (`pm_ec2-sg`). Restricts outbound traffic.
-   **Network ACLs (NACLs)**: Optional stateless firewall layer for subnets, providing an additional layer of security (can be used for blacklisting specific IPs).

## 🤖 DeepSeek Chatbot Integration

-   **What it does**: Allow users to create calendar events using natural language input.
    -   Example: User inputs `"I have work from 9am-5pm and then dinner from 8pm-9pm"`.
    -   An integrated chatbot (DeepSeek) parses this text, extract event details (title, start time, end time), and interact with the backend API to create these events in the user's calendar.
